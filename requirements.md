Digital Scoresheet user manual
Requirements
For running only the scoresheet application without any video features only some very basic hardware / software requirements have to be
fulfilled:
Laptop, preferably with at least 14'' display and a minimum screen resolution of 1280x1024
Windows 7, 8, 8.1 or 10
Laser or inkjet printer (preferably colour printer)
The PC has to be configured to use Regional Settings = "English (USA)"
It is also recommended to provide an additional monitor for the commissioner as a second screen (duplicate laptop screen)
Note: you will need administrator access to the laptop on which you are running the software.
Installing the Software
An installation wizard will guide you through the installation - the software can be installed with all default options.
Note: while installing the software on computers running Windows 8 a message "Windows SmartScreen prevented an
unrecognized app from starting" might pop up. In this case please simply select "More info", followed by "Run anyway".
You will also need to enter a key in order to activate the software - the activation key will be provided by FIBA separately. Click "Auto
Activate" afterwards. Each activation key can be used on a maximum number of 2 laptops / PC's. It is also possible to release a key from
one PC in order to use it on another afterwards - to do so, simply select "Configuration - Deactivate License".
When the software is started for the first time the following message pops up: "Application folder is empty! Please chose application folder
first!". You will simply need to select the folder in which all scoresheet data is stored. The "Share Folder" option is not needed for your
purposes, please keep the checkbox disabled (see screenshot below).
Starting a new game
"New game": all game information and players will be entered manually
"Import game": if a game has been created on a different PC an xml file can be imported
"Download game": for all games in FIBA competitions all data (game and players) can be downloaded from the FIBA servers.T his is
the way the software will be used in all FIBA competitions
The username and password will be provided separately by FIBA
New Game
Note: as mentioned above, "New Game" is only for testing or working during friendly games. For all official FIBA games the "Download
Game" procedure has to be followed.
Simply enter all information manually (note: game number is always required and has to be unique).
In order to enter team names and players select the "Teams Info" tab. Players are added or deleted by clicking the + and - icons.
Download Game
After selecting "Download Game" on the main screen you simply need to log on to the FIBA Europe CMS and select a game from the list by
double clicking it.
The game is now added and all game and player information is available automatically. If changes are necessary (for example players need
to be added or removed this can be done in the same way as described above using the +/- icons, player details can be edited by doubleclicking
the player's name.
The teams' uniform colors can be edited by selecting the respective "Team Color" button.
Note: the player information / roster is also accessible from the main window of the software with the "SUB" (substitution) icon.
The Main Window
Action buttons:
Green buttons (1, 2, 3): 1, 2, 3 points scored
White buttons: TO = Timeout; SUB = substitution (the SUB button is also used before the game to enter the starting 5 and to mark the
team captains)
Yellow buttons (P0, P1, P2, P3): Personal Foul with 0/1/2/3 Freethrows
Orange button "U": Unsportsmanlike Foul
Pink buttons: Technical Fouls. T = player; C = coach; B = bench
Red buttons: Disqualifying Fouls. D = player or coach; F = player disqualified for leaving bench area during a fight
The new foul type (2014/15 season) "GD" (game disqualification) will be added automatically in case a player or coach has reached the
maximum number of technical / unsportsmanlike fouls.
In the event that for example the names of the coaches are not fully visible, the space for the team rosters can be increased by dragging the
bar between teams and actions (see below).
Entering Actions
In principle all actions are simply entered by selecting a player / coach followed by the action (or the other way round). You will also need to
check the game time (minute, as it would appear on the paper scoresheet) and, in case of fouls the number of Free Throws and if the foul
should count as a team foul. The time can also be controlled from the main window - if it is adjusted for a new action it will also update the
current time in the main window.
Note: the time entered is the time as it will appear on the printed scoresheet, i.e. counting upwards. For example something that
happens with 8:13 on the scoreboard will be entered with game time 2.
Editing / Deleting Actions
All actions can be edited (for example changing the player of a foul or a 2PTS shot to a 3PTS shot) or deleted from the actions pane at the
bottom of the main window. Clicking the "Actions" button opens a new window with further search and filter options.
Printing / process for signing scoresheet
Even though workflows for using digital signatures are currently being investigated, in the current version of the software and for all official
FIBA competitions it is required to have signed copies of the scoresheet on paper.
In detail:
Before the game: an empty scoresheet with only game info and player / coaches names is printed (one copy only) and has to be
signed by both coaches as always 10 minutes before tip-off; this copy is kept by the commissioner
After the game: 4 copies of the scoresheet are printed and all of them are signed by the referees, table officials and, in case of a
protest, by the captain of the respective team; these copies are distributed in the same way as the "traditional" scoresheet (1 copy
each for FIBA, the organizer of the game and both teams)
In order to print the scoresheet click the pdf icon in the upper part of the main window,
